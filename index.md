## Alex Amiryan

I am a software developer and enterpreneur. I've started my career in 2003. My main areas of interest are security, encryption and privacy. I have an extended experience in Java, PHP, C#, Javascript, relational, document based and graph databases, encryption algorithms and crypto constructions.

Currently I am CEO and founder of [Stingle Photos](https://stingle.org), a secure, end-to-end encypted gallery and sync app.
